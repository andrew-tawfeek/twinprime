# Staircase corrections grouped by tree height

The recursive staircase detail is exactly the sum of the corrections at
the internal tree nodes. Grouping them by height provides the fixed levels
used in the maximal bilinear estimate. Triangle inequalities retain every
level and both factors of each rectangular correction.
