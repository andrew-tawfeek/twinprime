# Exact finite dyadic staircase identity

A nonincreasing natural boundary defines a finite staircase. Its weighted
sum equals a common rectangular baseline plus the rectangular corrections
at the internal nodes of a binary interval tree. Every boundary is retained
exactly; no approximation to a product cutoff is used.
