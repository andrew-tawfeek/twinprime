# Uniform nonvanishing constants for finitely many conductors

Qualitative nonvanishing at one and finiteness of the character groups give
positive uniform constants on every finite conductor range. The existing
derivative bound also gives a positive gap from one for every real primitive
zero in that range. No quantitative dependence of these constants on the
conductor cutoff is claimed.
