# Geometry of dyadic staircase corrections

Distinct tree nodes of equal height are disjoint. Their left halves are
therefore disjoint, while an antitone boundary makes their correction
intervals disjoint in the reverse order. All endpoints remain in the given
finite domains, including empty correction intervals.
