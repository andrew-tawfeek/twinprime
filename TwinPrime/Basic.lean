# Twin primes: definitions, equivalent formulations, elementary structure

The target theorem (the twin prime conjecture) is, verbatim,

  theorem twin_prime_conjecture :
      {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime (p + 2)}.Infinite

It is **open**. In this file it is recorded as the proposition `TwinPrimeConjecture`, and we
prove a number of things *about* it:

* equivalent formulations (unboundedness, `∀ N ∃ p > N`, frequently-at-top, the `6k ± 1` form,
  and equivalence with "bounded gaps `≤ 2`");
* elementary structure of twin primes (`p % 6 = 5` for `p ≥ 5`);
* Clement's criterion (1949): for `n ≥ 2`, `n` and `n + 2` are both prime iff
  `n (n + 2) ∣ 4 ((n - 1)! + 1) + n`;
* verified small instances.

Nothing here is deep; the point is to have a precise, machine-checked interface for the rest of
the project.
